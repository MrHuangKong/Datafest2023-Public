# DataFest 2023 - EDA of ABA Pro Bono Work Nationwide

## Overview
This repository contains the code and presentation created by me and my team for the **DataFest 2023** competition. Our project aimed to analyze legal conversations provided by the **American Bar Association (ABA)** and provide actionable insights for improving pro bono legal services.

### Team Accomplishment
- **Competition:** ASA DataFest 2023
- **Achievement:** Semi-finalists
- **Institution:** Capital University, Department of Mathematics
- **Date:** Spring 2023

## Project Components
1. **Jupyter Notebook Code:**
   - The primary analysis of the dataset was performed using Python in Jupyter Notebooks. Due to the **proprietary and sensitive nature of the dataset**, the code is provided without the data to comply with the **Proprietary Statement** set by the DataFest judges and the ABA.
   - The code I developed showcases our process of data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and model development to uncover trends in legal inquiries and provide actionable recommendations for the ABA.

2. **Team Presentation:**
   - Our final presentation, which was delivered to a panel of judges, provides a summary of our findings, visualizations, and recommendations for improving ABAâ€™s pro bono services based on our analysis. Including highlighting the discrepancies amongst states in the U.S.A.
   - The presentation is included as a **PDF** in this repository.

## Challenge Description
The multiple datasets provided by the ABA consisted of anonymized conversations between clients and volunteer lawyers, session metrics, time-to-completion, etc.. from 2016 to 2022, with an aggregate size of over ~1 million records. The goal of the challenge was to help the ABA understand what they did well, and what they did not. As well as understanding the demographic of pro bono clients. So that the ABA may anticipate the types of legal questions clients would ask, allowing the organization to better prepare its volunteers and tailor recruitment strategies for lawyers with specific expertise. 

### Summary of Our Analysis:
- **State Disparities in Legal Services:** Our analysis highlighted significant differences between states in terms of the number of cases per attorney and the average time attorneys spent on the platform. For example, states like Arizona had disproportionately high caseloads per attorney compared to states like Michigan, which demonstrated inefficiencies in the distribution of legal resources.
  
- **Unanswered Cases:** A critical issue identified was the overwhelming number of unanswered cases, with nearly one-third of client submissions (around 65,000 cases) never receiving a response. This indicated a nationwide problem in pro bono legal services, especially in states with fewer participating attorneys.

- **Client Demographics and Income Disparities:** We examined the client base, noting that most clients were living at, or below the federal poverty line, with an average annual income of $21,130. These findings underscored the importance of improving access to legal aid for low-income individuals, many of whom faced significant barriers in receiving timely assistance.

- **Recommendations:** We proposed several solutions to address these challenges, including:
  - **Client Outreach:** Expanding awareness of free legal services by advertising in local community centers, food banks, and family services.
  - **Attorney Engagement:** Encouraging attorneys to increase their pro bono work by emphasizing its importance and potential benefits to their practice.
  - **Platform Improvements:** Enhancing the platform by removing inactive attorneys to provide more accurate information on available resources, ultimately increasing the responsiveness of the system.
